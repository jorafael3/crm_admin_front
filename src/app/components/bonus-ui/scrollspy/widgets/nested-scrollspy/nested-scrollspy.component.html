        To implement a Navbar Scrollspy with nested navigation, start by adding a <code>nav</code> element with <code>ngbScrollSpyMenu</code> to track scrolling sections. Each navigation item should use <code>ngbScrollSpyItem</code> and reference the corresponding section. For nested navigation, wrap child items inside another <code>nav</code> element, ensuring they have <code>ngbScrollSpyItem</code> and a <code>parent</code> attribute linking them to their main section. This allows both main and nested items to highlight correctly as you scroll. Scroll through the sections below to see the active class update automatically.
