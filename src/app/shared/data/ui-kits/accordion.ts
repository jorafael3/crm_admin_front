Web design codes information in a way that search engines can read it. It can boost business because the site shows up on the top search result pages, helping people to find it.</li>
                              <li><strong> Mobile responsiveness:</strong> Mobile responsiveness is the feature of a website that allows it to display on a mobile device and adapt its layout and proportions to be legible. Web design ensures sites are easy to view and navigate from mobile devices. When a website is well-designed and mobile-responsive, customers can reach the business with ease.</li>
                              <li> <strong> Improved sales:</strong>Increasing the number of items sold or acquiring more active customers are objectives of a compelling website. As web design reaches targeted customers and search engines, it helps the business make conversions on their site and improve its sales.</li>
